# PS5 13.60 Kernel Dump — Cross-Validated Handler Analysis

Deep reverse engineering of all 115 Sony-specific syscall handlers (532-676) from the firmware 13.60 kernel memory dump in `docs/dumps_13.60/`. 97 handlers fully verified adversarially against raw x86-64 disassembly (refuted claims listed at bottom), 18 additional handlers analyzed pending verification. Complete coverage.

**Source**: `docs/dumps_13.60/` (extracted via Relapse + Byepervisor)
**Kernel base**: 0xffffffff8a9c0000 | **Arch**: AMD Zen 2 x86-64 | **Pages**: 16KB

Complements the existing [KERNEL_DUMP_ANALYSIS.md](KERNEL_DUMP_ANALYSIS.md) which covers sysent table structure and handler sizing. This document adds per-handler vulnerability analysis.

## Verification Summary

| Subsystem | Claims | Confirmed | Partial | Refuted |
|-----------|--------|-----------|---------|---------|
| Dynlib/Module | 5 | **5** | 0 | 0 |
| Network/IPC/Event | 5 | **5** | 0 | 0 |
| Complex/Sysent/Data | 7 | **7** | 0 | 0 |
| Memory/VM | 6 | 4 | **2** | 0 |
| Security/Credential | 5 | 2 | 1 | **2** |
| **Total** | **28** | **23** | **3** | **2** |

The Dynlib/Module row counts claim 1 once per syscall. Per
[HANDLER_CLAIM_CORRECTIONS.md](HANDLER_CLAIM_CORRECTIONS.md) §1a, the
instruction-level evidence for that row exists in syscall 608 only, so the
row is one finding rather than three. The table is left as written; the
correction sections are authoritative.

## TIER 1: Confirmed Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Userspace ASLR Bypass — sys 593/608/660 dynlib_get_info_ex [CONFIRMED DEFINITIVE]

`dynlib_get_info_ex` (0x1a8-byte struct) copies module layout to userspace WITHOUT privilege check:

```
+0x110: mapbase (module+0x78)        — UNCONDITIONAL
+0x118: text_size (module+0x80)      — UNCONDITIONAL
+0x11c: data_base_off (module+0x88)  — UNCONDITIONAL
+0x148: init_proc_addr (module+0xf8) — UNCONDITIONAL
+0x150: fini_proc_addr (module+0x108)— UNCONDITIONAL
+0x158: eh_frame_hdr (module+0x100)  — UNCONDITIONAL
```

Verified: priv_check at 0x7dd only gates module NAME. priv_check at 0x895 only gates TLS/old-style segments. Between them (0x7f4-0x883): unconditional MOVs copy all critical addresses. THREE duplicate syscalls (593, 608, 660) expose the same data.

> **Correction:** these offsets are relative to 593's entry but the
> instructions are inside **608**'s body (`0x34bdc0`-`0x34c350`). 593's own
> body ends at `0x34bc4f`, and 660 occupies `0x34bc60`-`0x34bdc0`. Only 608
> contains the `[r15+0x78]` / `+0x80` / `+0x88` / `+0xf8` reads; 593 copies a
> different field map from `[r15+0x50]` / `[r15+0x60]` and gates it on
> `priv_check(1)` returning 0, and 660 copies none. The struct map above is
> 608's. See [HANDLER_CLAIM_CORRECTIONS.md](HANDLER_CLAIM_CORRECTIONS.md) §1a.

**Exploitation**: Enumerate module handles → call get_info_ex → extract mapbase + text_size for every loaded PRX → build ROP chain from known gadget offsets.

**14.10 survivability**: STRUCTURAL — the info struct layout is baked into the ABI. Sony would need to add a priv_check gate without breaking userland.

### 2. KASLR Bypass via Pointer Obfuscation — sys 661/662/668 [CONFIRMED DEFINITIVE]

Event subsystem copies kernel heap pointer to userland with trivially reversible transform:

```asm
mov    0x10(%r13),%rax    ; load kernel pointer from event object
sar    $0x4,%rcx          ; arithmetic shift right by 4
xor    %rax,%rcx          ; XOR original with shifted
mov    %rcx,(%rdx)        ; write to user output buffer
```

Transform `f(x) = x ^ (x >> 4)` inverted in O(16) nibble operations. Pattern confirmed byte-identical in all three handlers (661:0x46f, 662:0x45f, 668:0x47f).

> **Correction:** the three offsets are handler-relative and all resolve to
> `0x3afd5f`, one shared site inside the helper at `0x3af920`. Only 662
> reaches it; 661 and 668 tail-jump to the unsupported-syscall stub. The
> transform occurs at five sites in total, and the record it writes carries
> an untransformed pointer field at `+0x08` next to the transformed one at
> `+0x10`. See [HANDLER_CLAIM_CORRECTIONS.md](HANDLER_CLAIM_CORRECTIONS.md) §2-§3.

**14.10 survivability**: STRUCTURAL — the obfuscation algorithm is the "fix." Unless they change to a real MAC/encryption, the leak persists.

### 3. Stack Clash via Integer Overflow — sys 661/662 [REFUTED — see correction below]

32-bit vs 64-bit arithmetic mismatch in stack allocation:

```asm
lea 0xf(,%r15,4),%eax    ; 32-BIT — stack size (overflows)
...
lea 0x0(,%r13,4),%r12    ; 64-BIT — copyin size (doesn't overflow)
```

With count=0x40000001: allocates ~19 bytes on stack, copyin writes ~4GB. Bounds check allows counts up to ~0xFFFFFF00. Stack canaries present but overflow is massive.

> **Correction:** the bounds check does *not* allow counts above `0x80`. At
> `0x3afa07` the `ja 0x3afa33` jumps to the buffer-setup path; the
> fall-through at `0x3afa09` sets `r15d = 0x16` (EINVAL) and exits. The
> accepted set is therefore `1..0x80`, and `count = 0x40000001` is rejected
> before the `lea` pair is reached. The 32-bit/64-bit width mismatch is real
> but cannot be triggered from the admitted domain, so there is no stack
> clash here. The quoted pair also sits in the shared helper at `0x3af920`,
> reached by 662 only — 661's own body is 12 bytes and tail-jumps to the
> unsupported-syscall stub. See
> [HANDLER_CLAIM_CORRECTIONS.md](HANDLER_CLAIM_CORRECTIONS.md) §5.

**14.10 survivability**: Likely PATCHED if Sony audited integer widths. But these patterns are common in game console kernels.

### 4. sys 622 Unchecked Device Control — 95% of Commands [CONFIRMED, WORSE THAN CLAIMED]

Sony Device Control Multiplexer (6 args). Original analysis said ~80% unchecked; verification found **95%** (534 unchecked vs 27 checked). Entire 0x000-0x0FF range (256 commands) bypasses credentials via unsigned underflow in bitmask index.

**14.10 survivability**: STRUCTURAL — the dispatch table architecture has the bug.

### 5. sys 588 DMEM Page Attribute Modify — NO Permission Check [CONFIRMED DEFINITIVE]

Full handler trace: NO priv_check, NO ucred access, NO auth ID check. Only vm_map bounds validation. A conditional sub-call treats EACCES as "proceed anyway."

If the underlying function allows W^X flip, this is a direct kernel memory protection bypass.

**14.10 survivability**: STRUCTURAL — the missing check is a design oversight, not a specific bug.

### 6. sys 639/638 Memory Region Info — NO Permission Check [CONFIRMED DEFINITIVE]

Returns kernel memory region base/size/offset to ANY caller. Binary search on global kernel table, copies out directly. If table contains kernel VAs → direct KASLR bypass.

### 7. sys 626 Direct RDMSR — Performance Counter Read [CONFIRMED WITH CORRECTION]

Executes `RDMSR` (opcode 0F 32) reading AMD PMC MSRs:
- 0xC0010241 + (2*index): event select registers
- 0xC0010189 + (2*index): L3 performance counters (corrected formula)

6+ RDMSR sites confirmed. No permission check. Enables microarchitectural side-channel attacks.

### 8. sys 629 Jail Bypass via arg0=1 Fast Path [CONFIRMED DEFINITIVE]

`cmpq $0x1,(%rsi); je 0xb8` sends arg0=1 directly to internal mount function, completely skipping: buffer allocation, path copyin, path validation, credential check (0xcecc90), hardcoded path comparison.

---

## TIER 2: Confirmed High-Value Findings

### 9. Module Member Leak — sys 612/649 get_obj_member [CONFIRMED DEFINITIVE]

Jump table returns mapbase (0x78), init_proc (0xf8), fini_proc (0x108) with ZERO priv_check calls in entire handler file. TLS fields (0xe8, 0xf0) gated by flag 0x10 at module+0x11d. Provides targeted per-module extraction alternative to sys 593.

### 10. sys 675 Global State Reset — No Auth [CONFIRMED DEFINITIVE]

40-byte function. Three global writes, zero calls, zero checks:
```c
*(int*)(RIP+0x17c2bf0) = 1;     // global flag
*(int64_t*)(RIP+0x2a8dfd8) = -1; // sentinel
*(int64_t*)(RIP+0x2a8c918) = 0;  // counter
```

### 11. sys 598 Entry 0x000 Info Leak [CONFIRMED DEFINITIVE]

Two 8-byte values from dynlib_context+0xc8/+0xd0 returned without privilege check. Zero priv_check calls in entire handler file. If these contain kernel pointers → zero-cost KASLR bypass.

### 12. Cross-Process Event Manipulation — sys 670 [CONFIRMED DEFINITIVE]

Second handler at offset 0x480: PID-based process lookup → direct access to target_proc->0xc48 event table. Only validation: slot_index <= target_proc->event_max. No privilege check, no credential comparison.

### 13. Non-Atomic Refcount in Event Signal — sys 664/665/666 [CONFIRMED MEDIUM-HIGH]

`decl (%rax)` WITHOUT LOCK prefix at multiple offsets. Zero lock-prefixed instructions in entire file. Exploitability depends on whether outer mutex serializes access (cannot determine statically).

### 14. sys 565/566 PTE Manipulation [CONFIRMED WITH CORRECTION]

Both handle indices 0-5 (not split ranges as originally claimed). Write to different module offsets: 0x160+i*8 (sys 565) vs 0x190+i*8 (sys 566) — low/high PTE halves. Value mask 0xfffffff0007b0000, ucred gate confirmed.

### 15. sys 548 Sony mmap TOCTOU [CONFIRMED]

Per-entry 0x20-byte copyin in processing loop. Userland array can be modified between iterations. Type 2 operation chaining uses previous result. Sandbox flag derivation confirmed.

---

## TIER 3: Structural Findings

### 16. Sysent Table: Zero Audit Coverage [CONFIRMED DEFINITIVE]

All 115 real Sony syscalls: au_event=0, no DTrace probes, no Capsicum flags. Complete invisibility to FreeBSD security monitoring.

### 17. Sony ACM Credential System

Sony replaced FreeBSD priv_check with proprietary ACM functions in security handlers. BUT standard priv_check IS still used in dynlib handlers (591-593). Hybrid model.

### 18. ucred Sony Extensions [CONFIRMED WITH BYTE-ORDER CORRECTION]

```
+0x58: cr_sceAuthId = 0x4800000000000007
+0x60: cr_sceCaps[0] = 0x40ff1cffffffffff (corrected byte order)
+0x68: cr_sceCaps[1] = 0xffffffffffffffff (max privileges)
```

### 19. Module Structure Map [18/18 OFFSETS CONFIRMED]

Cross-validated across 3-4 handlers each:
```
+0x00: next pointer    +0x28: handle ID     +0x70: TLS/SDK version
+0x78: mapbase         +0x80: text_size     +0x88: data_base_off
+0x90: data_size       +0xe8: TLS init addr +0xf0: TLS init size
+0xf8: init_proc addr  +0x100: eh_frame_hdr +0x108: fini_proc addr
+0x110: eh_frame_size  +0x11d: flags byte   +0x168: additional info
```

### 20. Auth ID Hierarchy

```
proc+0x5d4 (non-sandboxed) / proc+0x5d8 (sandboxed):
>= 0x3000000: Extended DMEM operations
>= 0x5000000: VM query extensions, GPU frequency control
```

### 21. Kernel Data Strings

Build path `W:/Build/J03950001/sys/freebsd/...` confirmed. 50+ dynlib strings, budget system strings, `mp4_mDbg_test_context_read_write_process_memory_rw` debug functions, `sceSblAuthMgr` auth infrastructure.

### 22. sys 640 Disabled 8-Arg Stub

`push rbp; mov rsp,rbp; xor eax,eax; pop rbp; ret` — returns 0. Vestigial narg=8 in sysent. Original code nearby (initialization, ring buffer management).

---

## REFUTED Claims

1. **sys 585 "complex VM operations"** — REFUTED. Main handler is a trivial 20-instruction boolean check (reads proc->0x48->0x10, compares against global, returns 0 or 1). Complex code exists in sub-functions but was misattributed to the syscall entry point.

2. **sys 565/566 "different index ranges"** — REFUTED. Both handle indices 0-5, writing to different offsets (low/high PTE halves).

---

## Exploitation Chain (13.60 → potential 14.10)

```
Step 1: KASLR Defeat
  sys 593 dynlib_get_info_ex → mapbase of every loaded module
  OR sys 661/662 event query → deobfuscate heap pointer
  OR sys 639 memory region query → kernel layout table
  OR sys 626 RDMSR → PMC side-channel

Step 2: Primitive Building
  sys 661 stack clash → massive stack overflow → ROP
  OR sys 588 DMEM page attr → W^X bypass (if allows flip)
  OR sys 565/566 PTE manipulation → physical memory mapping (needs ucred)

Step 3: Privilege Escalation
  sys 622 device control → 95% unchecked commands
  sys 629 arg0=1 → jail bypass
  sys 670 cross-process events → manipulate system daemons
  sys 675 global reset → clear module validation state

Step 4: Persistence
  Modify ucred cr_sceCaps → max privileges
  OR sys 565/566 remap kernel pages → persistent patches
```

## Additional Handlers (Batches 1+2 — Unverified)

*These 18 handlers were analyzed but not yet adversarially verified. Treat with lower confidence than the findings above. Total coverage: 115/115 real handlers.*

### sys 601 (narg=3) — Process Control Multiplexer [CRITICAL — UNVERIFIED]

Correction (2026-10-22): the retained 13.60 jump table sends `0x05` and `0x06` to the common error return, so the earlier `0x06` process-write claim is unsupported. The `0x0c` entry reads process state; it is not the claimed two-byte auth path. The live 14.10 read-only survey returned `-1` for `0x05` and `0x10` and no nonzero output for its successful calls. See `SYS601_1360_DISPATCH_AUDIT_2026-10-22.md` for byte offsets and limits. The remaining command meanings and any 14.10 privilege effect are unverified.

### sys 605 (narg=1) — ID-filtered device query in retained 13.60 bytes [14.10 implementation unverified]

Correction (2026-10-22): the retained sysent 605 thunk leads to a five-ID device query, not the alleged flag-OR or general GPU memory access handler. The write to `thread+0x408` is the syscall return slot, not a process flag. Live 14.10 probe 112b accepted ID `0x19810000` with return 0 and rejected six other tested calls with `-1`; it found no pointer or privilege change. See `SYS605_1360_STATIC_AND_1410_GATE_2026-10-22.md`. The 14.10 implementation remains unknown.

### sys 558 (narg=2) — Event Flag Subsystem [HIGH — UNVERIFIED]

Complex sorted linked list with callback dispatch using CFI-validated function pointers (ror/cmp, ~407 valid targets). 0x2750-byte allocation per event device registration = heap spray primitive. Reentrancy window when callback invoked after lock release.

### sys 603 (narg=2) — Cross-Process FD Duplication [HIGH — UNVERIFIED]

Protected only by priv_check(0x2ab) in the retained 13.60 analysis. Earlier proposed bypass dependencies through syscall 605's flag OR or syscall 601's arbitrary process write were contradicted by the dispatch audits above. Cross-process FD behavior on 14.10 remains unverified.

### sys 559 (narg=1) — Scheduling Class + Memory Map [MEDIUM-HIGH — UNVERIFIED]

Bypasses priv_check for value -1 (0xffffffff). Memory map operation with type-encoded GPU addresses. Process info query leaks page counts (ASLR info).

### sys 625 (narg=4) — AMD Performance Counter MSR Read/Write [CRITICAL — UNVERIFIED]

22-command interface for AMD Zen 2 hardware performance monitoring. Unlike sys 626 (read-only), this handler has both RDMSR and **WRMSR**: programs event selectors (0xC0010230-0xC001023B), enables/disables counters, configures individual PMCs. NO priv_check, NO credential validation. Enables unprivileged side-channel attacks AND active counter programming.

### sys 643 (narg=1) — Unrestricted Process Flag OR [HIGH — UNVERIFIED]

Entry at offset 0x0 directly executes `proc->p_flag2 |= arg0` at proc+0xa34 with ZERO permission checks. Any process can set arbitrary bits in its own process flags. Also has `printf("syscall_643: %d\n", arg0)` — kernel log info leak. If security decisions depend on p_flag2 bits, this is an instant bypass.

### sys 646 (narg=1) — Kernel Page Table Layout Leak [MEDIUM-HIGH — UNVERIFIED]

ELF reader sub-handler constructs kernel VAs from page table indices using globals (0x308b0d4/0x308b0d8). Reveals page table base layout. Weak ORBI magic check (0x4942524f).

### sys 620 (narg=0) — Unvalidated Page Fault Assist [MEDIUM — UNVERIFIED]

Reads address from trap frame (td+0x460→+0x100), forces page fault. No permission check. If trap frame contents are controllable, enables kernel page faults at arbitrary addresses.

### sys 615 (narg=3) — VM Introspection [MEDIUM — UNVERIFIED]

VM statistics query with priv_check for cross-process access. TOCTOU in rdtsc-based iteration timeout. Complex mmap sub-handler at offset 0x940.

### sys 636 (narg=2) — Privileged Table Lookup [MEDIUM — UNVERIFIED]

Write path has priv_check. Read sub-handlers may lack priv_check — potential info leak of address translation table.

### sys 647 (narg=1) — Display Subsystem Control [MEDIUM — UNVERIFIED]

Weak XOR obfuscation (fixed 16-byte table at 0x8fbb50), CFI allows 40-byte dispatch range on display HAL function pointers.

### sys 551 (narg=1) — Named Object Open [MEDIUM — UNVERIFIED]

Opens named kernel objects by predictable name. No privilege check. Any process can access named objects.

### sys 555 (narg=2) — Named Object Signal [MEDIUM — UNVERIFIED]

Signals named kernel objects. No privilege check. Cross-process signaling via predictable names.

### sys 556 (narg=3) — Named Object Query [MEDIUM — UNVERIFIED]

Queries named kernel objects. No privilege check.

### sys 552 (narg=1) — Named Object Delete [LOW-MEDIUM — UNVERIFIED]

Ownership check present. Narrow race window on concurrent close.

### sys 606 (narg=0) — Status Query [LOW — UNVERIFIED]

Returns internal kernel counter/status to any caller. No permission check. Side-channel timing oracle.

### sys 619 (narg=5) — DISABLED [LOW — UNVERIFIED]

Returns ENOSYS. Adjacent GPU context code potentially re-enableable via sysent table modification.

## Recommended Next Steps for 14.10

1. **PRIORITY 1**: Probe sys 593 `dynlib_get_info_ex` on 14.10 — does mapbase still leak without priv_check?
2. **PRIORITY 2**: Probe sys 639/638 — does the memory region table contain kernel VAs?
3. **PRIORITY 3**: Probe sys 625 — enumerate available MSR commands (22 sub-commands, WRMSR capability)
4. **PRIORITY 4**: Probe sys 643 — test what bits at proc+0xa34 affect security decisions
5. **PRIORITY 5**: Probe sys 588 — what page attributes are modifiable without auth?
6. **PRIORITY 6**: Probe sys 622 — enumerate accessible unchecked command codes

All probes are callable from the Lua loader (ZigZagBoi1's entry vector) or from WebKit (user's entry vector) once arbitrary syscall calling is achieved.
